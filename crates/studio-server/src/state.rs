//! Shared application state — `AppState`.
//!
//! Wave A3 wires the minimum cross-crate integration required to prove the
//! Axum app can hold a [`studio_store::Store`] handle and a future
//! [`studio_router::Router`]. The `router` slot is [`Option`] because:
//!
//! - A3 does not need a live LLM router (only `/api/health` + `/api/version`
//!   trivial routes ship this wave).
//! - [`studio_router::RouterBuilder::build`] requires at least one
//!   registered provider that matches the parsed
//!   [`studio_router::RouterConfig`]; A3 has no config file in flight.
//! - Wave A4 / A5 will plumb the real construction (per ADR-0006
//!   §"Addendum 2026-05-11" — `RouterConfig::from_toml_str(&toml)?` +
//!   `register_provider(...)` + `.build(&cfg).await?`).
//!
//! All `AppState` fields are documented; the struct is `Clone` because
//! Axum needs to hand a copy to each request future, and the underlying
//! [`studio_store::Store`] is `Arc`-shared internally.
